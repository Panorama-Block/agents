    Review the report and adapt it into a tweet divided into multiple parts.
    Make sure each part is concise and contains relevant information that can be posted as a thread on twitter.
    The content should be naturally divided into sections that make sense when read together or separately.
  expected_output: >
    Generate parts of the tweet that will be posted as a thread. Each part should be self-contained but also flow naturally when read in sequence.
    Each part need to be less than 200 characters.

    Don't add bets and sports related content
