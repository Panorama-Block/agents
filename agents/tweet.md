Crypto market = mixed bag. Caution advised. Dip-buying present but lacks momentum. Watch trading volume for breakout signals.  Bittensor/Virtuals focus on trust & AI scoring. Ronin Network consolidating. Vain market cap down to $1.3B. Bet against Walz Senate run seems mispriced. Base network booming: $5B bridged, 10M weekly tx, $4B TVL, aiming for 250 mgas/s by 2025.  Beware meme-coin rug pulls! #crypto #marketanalysis #blockchain
